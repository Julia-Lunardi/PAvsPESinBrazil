# Protected Areas vs Payment for Ecosystem Services in Brazil

This is the code I am developing for my Master's thesis about the effectiveness
of Protected Areas versus Payment for Ecosystem Services in deforestation and po-
verty in Brazil. 

## Loading the packages and data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```

Loading the data
```{r}
brazil.biomes <- st_read("/Users/juliaabdalla/Desktop/Data Thesis/Biomas_250mil/lm_bioma_250.shp")

```

For determining which Coordinate Reference System (CRS) the data was built with
```{r}
st_crs(brazil.biomes)

```
This tells me that this object is projected.
